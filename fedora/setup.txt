	If you are using the b43 driver from 3.2 kernel or newer:
		~>export FIRMWARE_INSTALL_DIR="/lib/firmware"
		~>wget http://www.lwfinger.com/b43-firmware/broadcom-wl-5.100.138.tar.bz2
		~>tar xjf broadcom-wl-5.100.138.tar.bz2
		~>sudo b43-fwcutter -w "$FIRMWARE_INSTALL_DIR" broadcom-wl-5.100.138/linux/wl_apsta.o
	To load specific driver use one of the following commands:
	(NOTE:you can pick only one command, if you know which driver is in use)
		~>modprobe b43
		~>modprobe brcmsmac
		~>modprobe wl
	To unload all known drivers
		~>modprobe -r b43 bcma
		~>modprobe -r brcmsmac bcma
		~>modprobe -r wl
	It is possible to prevent system from auto-loading some drivers by blacklisting them. This can be done with the following command
		~>echo "blacklist drivername" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
	NOTE:If you plan to use wl, you should blacklist b43 and brcmsmac as well as bcma.
		Unfortunately wl does not use bcma bus driver, so this additional step is required.
