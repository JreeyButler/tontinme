#iops
	input/output operation per second
	IOPS is a common performance measurement used to benchmark computer storage devices like hard disk drives(HDD)
		solid state drivers(SSD),and storage area networks(SAN). As with any benchmark, IOPS numbers published
		by storage device manufactures do not guarantee real-world application performance
	即每秒进行读写操作(I/O)的次数，多用于数据库等场合，衡量随机访问的性能
	存储端的iops性能和主机端的IO是不同的，IOPS是指存储每秒可接受多少次主机发出的访问，主机的一次IO需要多次访问
		存储才可以完成
	The most common performance characteristic are as follows:
		measurement		Description
		Total IOPS		Total number of I/O operation per second (when performing a mix of read and write tests)
		Random Read IOPS	Average number of random read I/O operations per second
		Random Write IOPS	Average number of random write I/O operations per second
		Random Read IOPS	Average number of sequential read I/O operations per second
		Random Write IOPS	Average number of sequential write I/O operations per second
	For HDDs and similar electromechanical storage devices, the random IOPS numbers are primarily dependent upon the 
		storage device's random seek time(寻道时间) 	'
	For SSDs and similar state storage devices, the random IOPS numbers are primarily dependent upon the storage device's   '
		internal controller and memory interface speeds.
	On both types of storage devices the sequential IOPS numbers(especial when using a large block size) typically indicate 
		the maximum sustained bandwidth that the storage device can handle
	Often sequential IOPS are reported as a simple MB/s number as follows:
		IOPS*TransferSizeInBytes = BytesPerSec(with the answer typically converted to MegabytesPerSec)
	EXAMPLE:
		Device			Type	IOPS		Interface
		7,200 rpm SATA drives	HDD	~75-100 IOPS	SATA 3 Gb/s
		10,000 rpm SATA drives	HDD	~125-150 IOPS	SATA 3 Gb/s
		15,000 rpm SAS drives	HDD	~175-210 IOPS	SAS
