#split brain
	Clusters Systems are geared to handle peculiar situations like Amnesia and split brain conditions.
	Amnesia occurs when the cluster restarts after a shutdown with cluster data older than at the time 
		of the shutdown. This can happen if multiple versions of the framework data are stored on 
		disk and a new incarnation of the cluster is started when the latest version is not available.
	Split Brain occurs when a single cluster has a failure that results in reconfiguration of cluster 
		into multiple partitions, with each partitions forming its sub-cluster without the knowledge
		of the existence of other. This would lead to collision and corruption of shared data as 
		each sub-cluster assumes ownership of shared data.
	The methods that are used to solve Split Brain are "quorum" and "fencing"
	Fencing:
	  Resource fencing: if you know what resources a node might be using, then you can use some method of keeping it from
		accessing those resources. 
	  Node fencing: one can keep a node from accessing all resources -- without knowing what kind of resource
		it might be accessing, or how one might deny access to them. A common way of doing this is to power off or reset
		the errant node. This technique is also called SHONITH - which is a graphic and colorful acronym standing for 
		Shoot The Other Node In The Head.
#Quorum
	The most classic solution to selecting a single subcluster is a majority vote. If you choose a subcluster with more than
		half of the members in it, then you know there can't be any other subcluster like this one.
	SCSI reserve: both nodes try and reserve a disk partition available to both of them, and the SCSI reserve mechanism that
		only one of the two of them can succeed.
	Quorum Daemon: It has a number of significant advantages over SCSI reserve - one of which is that it can conveniently and 
		reliably operate over geographic distances, making it ideal for disaster recovery type situations.
