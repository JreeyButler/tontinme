------nginx超时设置


#nginx超时设置
	1. send_timeout
	default:60
	Timeout is established not on entire transfer of answer, but only between two 
		operations of reading, if after this time client will take nothing, 
		then nginx is shutting down this connection
	即经过${send_timeout}时间后仍无请求该client，则nginx断开该连接
	2. fail_timeout和max_fails
	配合使用，来控制nginx怎样认为upsteam中的某个server是失效的.
	当在fail_timeout时间内，某个server连接失败了max_fails次，则nginx认为该server
		不工作了。同时，在接下来的fail_timeout时间内，nginx不再发送请求到该server
	3. proxy_connect_timeout & proxy_read_timeout
	connect_timout是连接client的超时时间，read_timeout是等待返回结果的超时时间
	proxy_read_timeout
		This directive sets the read timeout for the response of the proxied server. 
			It determines how long nginx will wait to get the response to a request.
			The timeout is established not for entire response. 
	proxy_connect_timeout
		Thie directive assigns a timeout for the connection to the proxyserver
		In contrast to connect_timeout, read_timeout will cache a server that puts your
			in it's connection pool but does not responds to you with anything beyond
			that
