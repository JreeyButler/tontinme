Syntax of ReST
================

QuickStart
===========
Structure
-----------
Text is separated by blank lines (one is enough). For example:

::
	This is a paragraph. It's quite
	short.

		This paragraph will in an indented block of
		text.

	This is another one.

Text Styles
------------
you may additionally mark text for *italics* with "*italics*" or **bold** with "**bold**".

if you want something to appear as a fixed-space literal(``moonspace,等宽字体``), use "``double back-quotes(两个反引号)``"

List
-----
enumerated lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. number
2. number 2, no blank line needed!

A. upper-case letters
   and it goes over many lines

   with two paragraphs and all!

a. lower-case letters

   3. with a sub-list starting at a different number
   4. make sure the numbers are in the correct sequence though!

bulleted list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
start the line off with a bullet point character - either "-", "+" or "*":

* a bullet point using "*"

  - a sub-list 

    + a sub-sub-list

  - another item

* another item

definition list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
what
  definition lists associate a term with a definition

*how*
  the term is a one-line phrase 

Preformatting (code samples)
-----------------------------
To just include a chunk of preformatted, never-to-be-fiddled-with text, finish the prior paragraph with "::".

The preformatted block is finished when the text falls back to the same indentation level as a paragraph prior to
the preformatted block.

A example::

    whitespace, newlines, blank lines, and all
      kinds of markup
   (like *this* or \this) is 

           preserved by literal blocks.
  (but not far enough)

Example over

**Note that:**
  If a paragraph consists only of "::", then it's removed from the output. But preformat is still actived.

Sections
---------
There are a single line of text with adornment: an underline alone, or an underline and an overline together, in dashes "-----",
equals "=====", tildes "~~~~~" or any of the non-alphanumeric characters = - ' : ` " ~ ^ * _ # + < > that you feel comfortable with.

The underline/overline must be at least as long as the title text.

All sections marked with the same adornment style are deemed to be at the same level.
