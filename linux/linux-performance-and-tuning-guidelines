#Linux performance metrics
	#Processor metrics
		#CPU utilization
			It describes the overall utilization per processor
			If the CPU utilization exceeds 80% for a sustained period of time,a processor\
				bottleneck is likely
		#User time	
			Depicts the CPU percentage spent on user processes,including nice time.
			High values in user time shows that the system performs actual work.
		#System time
			Depicts the CPU percentage spent on kernel operations including IRQ and softirq time
			High and sustained system time values can point you to bottlenecks in the \
				network and driver stack.
		#Waiting
			Total amount of CPU time spent waiting for an I/O operation to occur.
			A system should not spend too much time waiting for I/O operations.
		#Idle time
			Depicts the CPU percentage the system was idle waiting for tasks.
		#Nice time
			Depicts the CPU percentage spent on re-nicing processes that change the execution \
				order and priority of processes.
		#Load average
			The load average is the rolling average of tht sum of the following:
			 - The number of porcesses in queue waiting to be processesed
			 - The number of processes waiting for uninterruptable task to be completed.
			If processes that request CPU time are blocked (which means that the CPU has no \
				time to process them), the load average will increase. On the other hand,\
				the load will decrease.				
		#Runable processes
			This value depicts the processes that are ready to be executed.
			This value should not exceed 10 times the amount of physical processors for a sustained \
				period of time.
		#Blocked
			Processes that cannot execute while they are waiting for an I/O operation to finish.
			Blocked processes can point you toward an I/O bottleneck.
		#Context switch
			Amount of switches between threads that occur on the system.
			High numbers of context switches in connection with a large number of interrupts can \
				signal driver or application issues.
		#Interrupts
			The interrupts value contains hard interrupts(more adverse effect) and soft interrupts.
			High interrupt values are an indication of a software bottleneck, either in the kernel \
				or a driver.
			Remember that the interrupt value includes the interrupts caused by the CPU clock.
