#Linux performance metrics
	#Processor metrics
		#CPU utilization
			It describes the overall utilization per processor
			If the CPU utilization exceeds 80% for a sustained period of time,a processor\
				bottleneck is likely
		#User time	
			Depicts the CPU percentage spent on user processes,including nice time.
			High values in user time shows that the system performs actual work.
		#System time
			Depicts the CPU percentage spent on kernel operations including IRQ and softirq time
			High and sustained system time values can point you to bottlenecks in the \
				network and driver stack.
		#Waiting
			Total amount of CPU time spent waiting for an I/O operation to occur.
			A system should not spend too much time waiting for I/O operations.
		#Idle time
